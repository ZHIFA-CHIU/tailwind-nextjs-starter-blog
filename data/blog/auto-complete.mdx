# Autocomplete

<AutoComplete />

## Question

Create an autocomplete UI component where users can type a search term into a text field, view matching results in a dropdown list, and select an item from the list.

- [Google search bar](https://www.google.com)
- [Tradingview stock search](https://www.tradingview.com/)

A backend API is available that returns a list of results corresponding to the search query.

## Requirements

1. Should only returns text results.
2. Component will be used in browser.
3. fuzzy search.

## Architecture

- Input
  - Text field for user input.
- Dropdown list
  - Displays matching results based on user input.
  - Should be scrollable if there are many results.
- Cache
  - Cache results to avoid unnecessary API calls.
- Controller
  - Passes user input and results between components.
  - Fetches results from the server if the cache is empty for a particular query.

## Data model

- Controller
- Cache

## API

- Number of results to return.
- API URL.
- Event listeners.
- Customized rendering

## Perfomance

- Debounce input to avoid excessive API calls.
- Cache results to minimize network requests.
- Add loading state to indicate when results are being fetched.

## Possible possible enhancements
